# Mobos2018

This repository contains my presentation for Mobos 2018 together with the material that supports it.

[Mobos](http://romobos.com/) is a conference focused on Mobile Technologies organized in [Cluj-Napoca Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluj-Napoca). The conference took place on 15th February 2018.

Topic of the presentation was [Tackling Common Vulnerabilities](http://romobos.com/blog/mircea-vasiliniuc-on-tackling-common-vulnerabilities).
*To provide a complete mobile application, its vulnerabilities must be discovered by the development team and addressed immediately. We will talk about a few simple and common vulnerabilities, about how to find them and how to solve them.*

## Content

### Slides
Slides of my presentation can be found in [Slides](https://github.com/mvasiliniuc/Mobos2018/blob/master/Slides/Mobos_2018.pdf)


### Code
Source code used in demo can be found in [Samples](https://github.com/mvasiliniuc/Mobos2018/tree/master/Samples)

The [Mobos2018_app](https://github.com/mvasiliniuc/Mobos2018/tree/master/Samples/Mobos2018_app) contains the sample app containing mitigations for the following vulnerabilities:
* Screen capture by Task-Switcher
* Keyboard logging, Autocomplete
* General Pasteboard
* It also demonstrates State Preservation but without the suggested mitigation: encryption.

The [Mobos2018_attacker](https://github.com/mvasiliniuc/Mobos2018/tree/master/Samples/Mobos2018_attacker) contains the sample app for keyboard extensions and pasteboard "observer".

### Resources

All material used in the making of the presentation (and much more!) can be found in [Resources](https://github.com/mvasiliniuc/Mobos2018/blob/master/Resources.md). This page can be a starting point if you want to research vulnerabilities in iOS applications.
